## Selected projects in Data Science and  Machine Learning 

**Ames House Price Predictions:** This project involved using Ames Iowa Housing Dataset to build a linear regression model to predict apartment prices. It entailed importing and cleaning data from a CSV file, building data visualizations, and examining the relationship between variables using correlation. I also created a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and improved model performance by reducing overfitting.

**Air quality in Seoul:** In this project I built an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Seoul, South Korea. I also improved model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

**Bankruptcy in Taiwan:** This project was all about building random forest and gradient boosting models to predict whether a company will go bankrupt. I navigated the Linux command line, addressed imbalanced data through resampling, and considered the impact of performance metrics precision and recall.

**Customer Segmentation in the US:** In this project I built a k-means model to cluster US consumers into groups. I also used principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization, and created an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.

**Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM:** Here I Used Keras to build a LSTM to accurately predict stock prices of a financial firm using historical closing prices and trading volume and visualise both the predicted price values over time and the optimal parameters for the model. This project Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)  algorithm to make predictions.
