## Selected projects in Data Science and  Machine Learning 

**Ames House Price Predictions:** This project involved using Ames Iowa Housing Dataset to build a linear regression model to predict apartment prices. It entailed importing and cleaning data from a CSV file, building data visualizations, and examining the relationship between variables using correlation. I also created a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and improved model performance by reducing overfitting.

**Air quality in Seoul:** In this project I built an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Seoul, South Korea. I also improved model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

**Bankruptcy in Taiwan:** This project was all about building random forest and gradient boosting models to predict whether a company will go bankrupt. I navigated the Linux command line, addressed imbalanced data through resampling, and considered the impact of performance metrics precision and recall.

**Customer Segmentation in the US:** In this project I built a k-means model to cluster US consumers into groups. I also used principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization.

**Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM:** Here I Used Keras to build a  Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) algorithm to accurately predict stock prices of the four tech giants (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft) using historical closing prices and trading volume over time and the optimal parameters for the model.

**Earthquake Damage in Nepal:** This one was about building logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings. It involved  revealing the biases in data that can lead to discrimination.
